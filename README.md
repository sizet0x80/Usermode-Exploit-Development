# Usermode-Exploit-Development
Windows Usermode Exploitation

PoC's for various exploits for educational purposes.

In this repo I will be uploading Proof of Concept exploits that I've rewritten for pre-existing exploits in software, and any usermode 0days or CVE's I have in the future.
The majority of these will mostly be Windows based.
